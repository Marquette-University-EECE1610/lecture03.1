# Lecture 3.1: Functions in Python

This repository contains example code for the first lecture of the third week, focusing on **defining and using functions** in Python.

## Topics Covered

- **Function Basics**: Defining simple functions and understanding function calls
- **Parameters & Arguments**: Working with function parameters, type hints, and return types
- **Return vs Print**: Understanding the difference between returning values and printing output
- **Scope**: Exploring variable scope in functions and how local/global variables work
- **Built-in Functions**: Working with Python's built-in functions
- **Code Organization**: Writing clean, maintainable function-based code
